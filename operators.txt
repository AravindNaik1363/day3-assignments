1.It will print 0 because == operator is used to check if its left-hand side operand is equal to right-hand side operand. 
Since 1 is not equal to 5, 
so the condition became false and thus printed 0.

2.The output of the above code is: 1 0

Because first it store i,i++ in the form of stack.

First execution is last in(first out) ie..

1)print i value in (i++)

then increment i to 1;

2)secondly print incremented i value ie.i;

3.The output will be 7,6,5.
